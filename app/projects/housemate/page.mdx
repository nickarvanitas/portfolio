# Housemate
**TLDR: Housemate is a concept real estate application that I brought through the design process. The highlight of this project was creating a highly animated prototype that's visible [here](/projects/housemate#final-deliverable).**

## Background
A college assignment I had was to design an application from the ground up over the course of a semester. In hindsight, I could've taken a more unique approach to a real estate application. However, I included it anyways because I felt it best demonstrated all the steps of the design process.  

### Role
Interaction Designer

## Research

### Concept Map
A concept map was first created to establish everything I currently knew. Similar ideas were linked together to create one giant web of knowledge. This helped me consider everything and identify a likely user group.

### Personas

From the concept map and some other user interviews personas were created to act as a reference point for the rest of the project.

### Site Map

After considering everything that could be needed, and who my users were a site map could then be created. I designed it first in sticky notes because it allowed the groupings to easily be changed as needed. A site map helped establish a clear hierarchy of information.

## Design

### Colors

<Wrapper gridWidth={4}>
  <Container width={1} bgColor={'#34495E'}><ColorBlock color={'white'}>#34495E</ColorBlock></Container>
  <Container width={1} bgColor={'#E67E22'}><ColorBlock color={'white'}>#E67E22</ColorBlock></Container>
  <Container width={1} bgColor={'#ECF0F1'}><ColorBlock color={'black'}>#ECF0F1</ColorBlock></Container>
  <Container width={1} bgColor={'#F9F9F9'}><ColorBlock color={'black'}>#F9F9F9</ColorBlock></Container>
</Wrapper>

### Typography
<div style={{fontFamily: 'Helvetica'}, {paddingTop: '16px'}}>
  <div style={{fontWeight: 700, fontSize: '40px'}}>40px Bold</div>
  <div style={{fontWeight: 400, fontSize: '24px'}}>24px Regular</div>
  <div style={{fontWeight: 400, fontSize: '18px'}}>18px Regular</div>
  <div style={{fontWeight: 700, fontSize: '16px'}}>16px Bold</div>
  <div style={{fontWeight: 700, fontSize: '14px'}}>14px Bold</div>
</div>



### Sketching & Wireframing

I started with a quick sketch to not waste time in the final design. A wireframe helped me with basic layout

### Mockups

Colors and images were then added to the wireframes to create high fidelity mockups.

### Prototypes

One of the final steps was importing the images into Principal (a prototyping software). I wanted the final prototype to be pretty flexible in terms of when things were clicked so a lot of the animations were looped so a user could click them at anytime. This was the final artboard.
