# Create Room
**TLDR: Through focusing on the user flow, I was able to identify key customer pain points. I was then able to design, develop, and colloborate with team members to improve these areas.**

## Background
Create Room is a furniture company that specializes in crafting furniture and accessories. They sell millions of dollars worth of products across the US, Canada, and the UK. 

### Problem
My objective at Create Room was very simple: **Increase Sales**. Due to the nature of the small team, there wasn't a lot of room for colloboration. More often than not, I was left to my own devices, and found myself gravitating towards what I knew best: **Creating an exellent web experience**.

### Brief

To start, my plan of action was the following:

* Map out User Flow
* Dig into Analytics
* Content Audit
* Design Audit

### Role
UX Engineer in a Marketing Team

***

## Discovery

### Digging into Analytics 
I started looking at analytics with the goal of identifying areas of improvement. I wanted to know things such as what products were underperforming, where are people dropping off the site, and how are people interacting with the site.

### User Flow Charts

> 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes - Pareto Principle

Identifying the main user flow helped dial in my focus even more. I decided to focus on pain points that effected the majority, instead of 'edge cases' that only effected some of the users. This data also provoked a lot of questions I had such as
- What's causing large drop offs on Homepage / Product Page / Cart Page?
- Would it be better to not send users to the 'Detail' page?
- Can we better funnel users from high traffic areas (such as blog) to the product page?
- What information are users coming to our site with?
- What goals do the users have at each of the steps?

While some of these I could answer by looking at more graphs, to feel confident about my hypothesis I would have to reach out to individual users.

### Content Auditing
> To fix a problem you first have to understand what you are dealing with

### Viewing Previous Designs

Now that I knew what the main flow was, I had to familiarize myself with the respective pages. 
 
<Tabs items={['Homepage', 'Detail Page','Product Page', 'Cart Page']}>
  <Tab>
    ![Homepage](/cr/homepage.jpg "Old Cart Page")
    > Old Homepage
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ![detail](/cr/detail_old.png "Old Detail Page")
    > Old Detail Page
    </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ![dreambox](/cr/dreambox_old.png "Old dreambox Page")
     > Old Product Page
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ![Cart Page](/cr/cart_old.jpg "Old Cart Page")
    > Old Cart Page
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

I made note of any weird functionality such as
* Homepage CTA links to detail page instead of product page
* Homepage has steps listed out that are vague
* Product Page doesn't look like traditional product page. Loading is very slow
* Cart Page's Checkout button is very far down on the page

#### Removing Clutter

Create Room had never really had a dedicated web person before I joined the team. This caused all of their assets to be really bloated and I frequently saw things like

``` js 
product.template.json
product2.template.json
product3.template.json
product4.template.json
product5.template.json
product_new.template.json
product_final.template.json
product_final_final.template.json
```

With no idea which one was current.

I knew **if I wanted to accomplish things in a reasonable timeframe I'd first have to take time to simplify and reduce clutter.** When I was finished, the number of files shrank from 802 to around 500, and made the site more manageable

### Site Recordings & Heat Maps

Once I had my list of site features, I began to look at how (and if) users were interacting with them. **Heat Maps** gave me a general idea of what users were interacting with / not interacting with. While **Site Recordings** helped boost my confidence about any hypothesis I already had. I was able to generate the matrix below based off my findings


|  | Homepage | Detail Page | Product Page | Cart Page |
| --: | :- | :- | :- | :- |
| **Goals** | Learn about product & navigate to product page | Learn about product & navigate to product page | See product variations, pricing, and add items to cart | Checkout
| **Pain Points** | Confused by 'step' messaging | Frustrated with extra step that has similar content to homepage | Loading Slow, not scrolling page | Missing important information below fold 
  

### Building Out Requirement List

Armed with the knowledge of where the customers were going, what they were doing, and what obstacles were in their way, I started creating a list of requirements that would be accomplished in the upcoming design.
<Tabs items={['Homepage', 'Detail Page','Product Page', 'Cart Page']}>
  <Tab>
    - Decrease Scroll Depth
    - Introduce More Products
    - Remove Clutter
    - More 'Sales-y' (Cialdini's 6 principles)
    - Give customers  
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    - Optional step in the flow
    - Clear 'Shop Product' button
    - More Valuable information on Product
    </Tab>
  <Tab>
    - Decrease Loading time
    - Decrease Scroll Depth
    - Progressive Disclosure to not overwhelm customers with information
    - Clearer price messaging
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    - Establish a more clear visual hierarchy
    - Remove unused page features (financing / product count stepper)
    - Hide $0 savings if not applicable
    - Shorter page length & checkout button at the bottom (for people that skim)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Design

### Design Review

With the requirements laid out for each page, I could begin working through the design phase! I've included some of the thoughts I was having while going through the pages.
#### Homepage

#### Cart

### Developer Review

Normally, before spending too much time on design I would try to meet with the development team to gauge their talent and what's possible within the given timeframe. **What's the purpose of designing something if it can't be implemented?** In this case, since I was both, I was able to have fun internal conversations with myself about what would and wouldn't work. 


### Sketching & Wireframing

To get a general idea of layout, wireframes were created. I didn't want to spend too much time on them though, since I could make final tweaks in development.

## Development

### Managing the Unmangeable

As I mentioned before, when I started at Create Room, their website hadn't had a dedicated person for over a year. The result of that was a tangled / unmangeable mess of code, that made it increasingly difficult to make any organized changes.

What complicated this even more, is that **new features we're constatly being prioritized over optimizations**. If I wanted the development environment to get any better I had to be smart and efficient with my changes.

### Removing Clutter

There's few things I love more than being able to delete 100's of lines of unused code. Lucky for me, our site had thousands. At first I was very hesitant and careful, and took time to understand what each line of code was doing. But as this slowed down the process dramatically, I shifted into more of a *move fast and break things* mentality. I figured that anything that was broken in the process could always be fixed and made better later on.

### Migrating to a supported Shopify theme
One of the big projects I accomplished, was moving out development environment to a Shopify supported theme. Before we were using a 3rd party theme that hadn't been updated for years, and had been mangeled by a slew of different people working on the site. **Switching to a supported theme, meant that I was no longer the only one working on our website, since the site could now recieve constant updates from the main github branch.**

### Adopting TailwindCSS
> TailwindCSS helped me as a developer match external designs that differed from our design conventions

What started as SCSS using BEM methodology, transitioned into a love for TailwindCSS. It helped me greater match external designs without spending hours writing media queries. 

### Hosting Images Locally
![dreambox](/cr/dreambox_old.png "Old dreambox Page")
> Old Product Page had a large initial load time

One of the worst things I saw at Create Room, was their hero product page which took 10+ seconds to load (on a fast computer). The previous developer had setup an external content management app with a database that was downloading ~90 images (for each of the product variantions) that weren't optimized for web. 

Knowing that I could host images on Shopify (so we wouldn't have to connect to a 3rd party database), and after realizing I could reproduce the same functionality with metafields, I made the decision to move everyhing over. 

I leveraged Photoshop scripts to automate re-exporting the images (which saved me loads of time and headache).

## AB Testing

Even though these pages launched, my work wasn't done. It's important to continually review and monitor changes to ensure they're having a positive impact. With a small team, we've ideated, designed, and launched a few AB tests to give this new cart page the best chance possible to succeed.
